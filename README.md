# 𓇋𓈖𓊪𓅱𓏟 Inpu - Hieroglyphic Input
---
**Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic input** inspired by Japanese [IME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method), on the web. 
Demo currently hosted **[here](https://inpu.vercel.app)**.

Select an input mode between phonographic transliteration, Gardiner codes, and hieroglyph description keywords; type away, select your hieroglyph between the set of candidates presented, and the output will be [Unicode characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Hieroglyphs_(Unicode_block)) that can have common text-processing tasks performed on them, like copying and searching.

Note that the [hieroglyph set](https://github.com/arsaccol/inpu/blob/main/src/assets/hieroglyph_data.sql) is still incomplete, and we are working on expanding it.
